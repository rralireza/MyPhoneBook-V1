Hello Guys,

I created a really simple PhoneBook with Pure PHP and MySQL!

1 - At the first, you have to create your account in "Register.php" page!

2 - Then you should login from "Login.php" page.

3 - Congrates! You're in you're personal PhoneBook.

4 - Now you can add you're contacts really easily and also Edit and Delete them!

I added the "phonebook.sql" file and you can import it in you're MySQL and use it!

Thanks to "Ahmad Al-Shahawi" for his great and simple template that really help me to write my own PHP codes in there.
